# Politics of Emotions: Emotion Detection and Rhetorical Framing in Political Discourse
This project explores how emotional language is used strategically in political texts to influence public perception and manipulate audience response. We build a pipeline using transformer-based models to detect emotional framing, categorize tone (e.g., fear, pride, outrage), and analyze shifts in sentiment across political stances and media sources.

# Objectives
- Detect and classify fine-grained emotions in political texts using a transformer model fine-tuned on the GoEmotions dataset.

- Examine the use of emotional framing across political actors, topics, and media outlets.

- Use explainability tools (e.g. SHAP, attention heatmaps) to highlight emotionally charged rhetoric.

- Visualize emotional patterns across ideological divides and time.
